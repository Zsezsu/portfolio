            I believe in a growth mindset, that skills can be developed through
            continuous learning and effort. I try to live my life by looking at
            challenges as opportunities and mistakes as valuable learning
            experiences. This is what I teach my students, and it provides a
            safe environment in which we can grow and work with ease.
